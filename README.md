 After removing zero values from the budget and revenue columns and addressing outliers, the analysis reveals a positive correlation between both budget and the number of votes with revenue. This suggests that, on average, higher budgets and a greater number of votes are associated with increased revenue. These findings strengthen the accuracy of conclusions drawn from the analysis, as steps were taken to handle potential data anomalies and improve the reliability of observed correlations.
